==============

Play the online game [2048](http://gabrielecirulli.github.io/2048/) in real life. 

Before starting the game, every player gets a card of value 2 or 4. 
After starting, each player tries to find someone with the same value on his/her card.
Once they found someone, they go to a central post together.

There, their cards add up: if value on their cards is 4, *one* card of value 8 is returned. Which of the two players gets the 8-card is decides by throwing dice, rock-paper-scissors or something similar.
The winner gets the 'added-up' card, the losing player gets a card lower than he came in with, e.g. a 2 or a 4. 

The game ends when you decide or cards run out. The winner is the player with the highest number.
