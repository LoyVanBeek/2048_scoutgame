==============

Play the online game [2048](http://gabrielecirulli.github.io/2048/) in real life. 

In the original 2048 game, numbers add up once they collide. 2 and 2 makes 4, 16 and 16 add up to 32 etc.

In this real-life game every player gets a card of value 2 or 4 when starting the game.
After the start, each player tries to find someone with the same value on his/her card.
Once they found such a player, they go to a central post together and hand in their cards.

At the central post, the cards add up: if value on the cards is, say 16, they add up to 32. But only *one* card of value 32 is handed back to the players. Which of the two players gets the 32-card is decided by throwing dices, rock-paper-scissors or something similar.
The winner gets the 'added-up' card, the losing player gets a card lower than he came in with, e.g. a 2 or a 4. 

After they leave the post, both players try to find someone with the same card again. 

The game ends when you decide or cards run out. Of course, the winner is the player with the highest number.
